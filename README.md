# ARYD - Big Data Programming Project
Analysis and Recommendation on YELP dataset

# Objective:
To provide useful insights using YELP dataset for businesses through big data analytics to determine strengths and weaknesses, so that existing owners and future business owners can make decision on new businesses or business expansion. Also to provide recommendation to both business owners and users by extensive analysis on data.

# Project Overview:
The project involves analysis on the dataset, visualization based on analysis and recommendations. Major modules of the project are
1. Validation of reviews on businesses based on user information.
2. Classification of positive and negative reviews using Machine Learning techniques.
3. Recommending location based “buzzwords” to future business owners by analyzing positive reviews and negative reviews for a businesses in a state.
4. User-specific recommendations using user’s history of availed services. Recommendations are provided based on categories of the services, location of the business, user reviews and user ratings.

Analysis was done on the dataset to understand correlation between different metrics like - location of business and its success, etc. Analysis on business trends based on location, ratings, category and attributes of the business was performed. Trends of closed businesses was observed using user reviews and ratings.

Few visualizations for the project were done using python libraries and are stored in [visualization](visualization) folder.
Remaining visualizations were done using tableau and the same can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZYQGXPHCP?:display_count=yes). View in full screen for better experience. 

# Steps for execution:
Dataset for the project should be downloaded from [Yelp dataset challenge](https://www.yelp.ca/dataset/download) and stored in yelp-dataset folder.
The codes should be executed in the order specified in [order_of_exec](order_of_exec.txt) file.
